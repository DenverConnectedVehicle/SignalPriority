RFI ATCMTD-I-002

This repository seeks information on technical approaches to implementing signal priority using Connected Vehicle (CV) Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). 

## Background
In 2018, the City and County of Denver (CCD) kicked off the Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment Program (ATCMTD) grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

ATCMTD funds cutting-edge transportation technologies to reduce congestion and improve the safety of our transportation system. This is a four-year, $12M effort. Denver is testing and demonstrating connected vehicle (CV) and infrastructure technology for improvements to congestion and safety for Denver residents and businesses.

The ATCMTD program is comprised of three projects: Connected Freight, Connected TMC and Fleet, and Connected Pedestrian. The program as a whole, as well as the projects underneath it, are designed to test the feasibility and value of using new technology to reduce congestion and improve safety. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the impact of the technology at a systems-level and build out the corresponding technology infrastructure necessary for the City to scale after the program concludes.

**This request for information seeks information on solutions that allow for traffic signal priority using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC).** Signal priority is a cross-project use case for ATCMTD, providing benefits to the Connected Freight Project, as well as the Connected TMC and Fleet project, which will include the city’s snow plow fleet.

### Vision Statement

The goal of this project is to provide prioritized signal timing through connected vehicle technology to freight and city fleet operators operating routes to businesses in and around the Denver metro area. Designated points of origin, and corridors will receive prioritized signal timing that will result in overall transportation operational and safety benefits for participating freight partners. This project will provide an incentive to freight operators to take more efficient routes, avoid local neighborhood roads, and reduce congestion. For snow plow operators in the city fleet, it will improve the operational efficiency of the city’s snow removal operations.

ATCMTD serves as the leading-edge transportation technology deployment grant for Denver. Many other Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and public works projects are looking to this program to identify viable signal priority solutions that meet a broader set of city needs. Technologies that meet Denver's needs here have the potential to scale across many city projects and programs.

## Requests for Comment and Information
Denver is seeking information on solutions that are ready to deploy today that meet the vision statement outlined above.
Solutions must:
* Utilize DSRC technology and appropriate standards (J2735 message formats, etc.)
* Allow an onboard unit (OBU) to generate a request based on a vehicle input, including from a vehicle's controller area network (CAN) bus, which may indicate a snowplow's plow is down and in use on a city fleet vehicle.
* Interface with an Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) via a contact closure, MIBs object via SNMP, or NTCIP object. 
Denver is seeking to procure and deploy this solution by December, 2019. 

## Process for commenting
Please use one of the two following methods for providing feedback on these technology specifications:
1. Submit a ticket on GitHub for broader recommendations, or non-specific edits.
1. If your proposed solution is not something your company is willing to share publicly, please email atcmtd@denvergov.org. Please note: Anything not marked, “trade secret”, or “proprietary confidential” may still be made public via public records request.

## Due Date and Time
This is an open RFI, and will remain open until Denver identifies and selects a solution to implement.

With the goal of implementing a solution by December, 2019, it’s requested that firms respond as soon and as often as feasible to allow for the city to test and procure the selected solution. Vendors may submit multiple informational proposals as market discovery, development, and solution deployment occur.

Denver welcomes feedback and updates from partners and industry experts of all kinds, including higher education, private sector firms and research organizations, public sector organizations, non-profits, and non-partisan community research organizations.
